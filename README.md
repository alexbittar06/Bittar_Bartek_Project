    python
    time, networkX

How would a TA run your program (did you provide a script to run a test case?)
    just running the code (python3 ______.py) will automatically run the tests on the data files in the folder

A brief description of the key data structures you used, and how the program functioned.
    arrays

A discussion as to what test cases you added and why you decided to add them (what did they tell you about the correctness of your code). Where did the data come from? (course website, handcrafted, a data generator, other)
    
An analysis of the results, such as if timings were called for, which plots showed what? What was the approximate complexity of your program?
    
A description of how you managed the code development and testing.

Did you do any extra programs, or attempted any extra test cases
